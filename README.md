Description
Do you have 10 minutes a day to add $4000 to your monthly income?

This is the average income difference between people who write down their goals and those who don’t. That’s one of many reasons why having a To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce the stress in your life and get more done in less time. It also helps you become more reliable for other people and save time for the best things in life.

In this project, you will create a To-Do list that will help you organize your life.
